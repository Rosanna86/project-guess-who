# Project: Guess Who 

In this week's project you'll create your own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?

I decided to make a little twist and make it Dino style!🦖

## How did I do it?
I started the project by going through the material and videos. I decided on the first day that I would change the characters. I chosed between monsters and dinosaurs.

What I learned:
* This week it was a lot of JS. I have learned about objects and arrays. And I have digged deeper in the endless world of JS. It drives my crazy and at the same time it enlightenings me in a very special way 👩‍💻

* To make my own characters forced me to think both two and three times about the code. Because I added new attributes to all the dinosaurs I had to make sure that everyting worked in the filter and compare sections. 

* For me it helped to divide the code in really small pieces. I solved the filter issue that I had by writing the code in if and else statements.

## When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools. My new thing is to use breakpoints in dev-tools. Really helpful. And I used #on-call-support channel on Slack and got help from a fellow class mate. 🙌🏻

My own reflection
This week was really intense but baby steps by baby steps I'm starting to grasp some JS.
